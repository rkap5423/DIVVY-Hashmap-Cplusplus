This project revolved around the DIVVY bicycle rental stations that are dotted around the city of Chicago. 
Given a data file of stations and trips, I had to construct a number of functions that allowed for 
looking up a specific station or trip given an inputted ID or name, the closest station given an inputted
set of coordinates, check how many times a certain bicycle had been used and on which trips, etc. 

The "main.cpp" file contains the bulk of the program, entirely created from scratch by me, 
including the various functions that allow for the aforementioned searching and such. 
"hashmap.h" contains the hashmap data structure that allows for the storing and accessing of the data, and
is largely created by me but references some other files and functions created by the professor, which
would be hash.h, hash.cpp, util.h, and util.cpp.
